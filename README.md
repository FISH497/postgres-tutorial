The tutorial will first lay the groundwork for the hands-on session by covering fundamential concepts:

We will wrap-up by introducing some of the more advanced features that build on the hands-on experience participants have just gained,  including:

    Triggers
    Stored Procedures

    Foreign Data Wrappers
